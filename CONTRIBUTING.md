# CONTRIBUTING

We welcome contributions to the JECA Nashville STEM Club guides, roadmap, and
documentation. We encourage students to engage with making updates,
improvements, and changes. To allow for dicussion or prioritization, please
ensure an [Issue](https://github.com/JECA-Nashville/stem-club/issues) exists for
any [pull-request](https://github.com/JECA-Nashville/stem-club/pulls) (PR) you
wish to create.

## Commit, PR, and Issue Content

- Be descriptive.

   If you are making a feature request for the roadmap, describe your desired
   outcome well enough to be understood even after months of not having thought
   about your idea. That way your idea can be evaluated by other members of our
   club without having to track down the originator of the idea.
- Link to related issues as appropriate.

   This is as simple as hash symbol (#) and its issue number.
   
   Example:
   Typing `#1` will result in a link to Issue [#1](https://github.com/JECA-Nashville/stem-club/issues/1).

## Code Standards

- Maximum 80 characters for Markdown documents.
